      <h1> What makes up a Game? </h1>
      
      <p>A Bot!Battle! Game consists of 4 components that must be uploaded to the initial configuration page.</p>
      <ul>
		<li> 
			<p><b>Game Name:</b> This name will be URL encoded and then used both in local storage file paths and urls to all game specific files and resources.
			<ul> 
				<li>  <p>All  files uploaded and derived from your uploads to initial configuration page will be stored in
					<ul>
						<li>  <p>application_root/local_storage/game_modules/[Game Name]
					</ul>
				<li>  <p>All game specific hosted files will be available at urls rooted at
					<ul>
						<li>  <p>/game/[Game Name]
					</ul>
				</li>
		
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> 
			<p><b>Game Rules</b>: A pdf file containing the rules of the game.
			<ul>
				<li><p> Hosted at: /game/[Game Name]/rules
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>  
			<p> <b>Game.java file</b> â€“ Please refer to the following java doc for help writing this class and implementing
				the GameInterface.
			<ul>
				<li><p><a href = "GameInterfaceJavaDoc/index.html"> GameInterface JavaDoc</a>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>  
			<p><b>Game Javascript</b> - [fileName].js
			<ul>
				<li>  <p>Hosted at: /game/[Game Name]/javascript
				<li>  <p>The built in test arena javascript file (testArena.js) will automatically load this file when the test arena page is loaded.
				<li>  <p>This file must implement a global javascript object named GAME that has a number of required functions that are called directly 
							by the built in test arena javascript file. See the <a href="./gameJsDoc.html" >Game js Documentation</a> for detailed 
							descriptions of these functions.
				<li>  <p>See the <a href="./testArenaDevelopersGuide.html" >Test Arena Developer's Guide</a> for more insight into when these
						methods are called and how they interact with the Test Arena.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>  
			<p> <b>Game Resources</b>: A zip archive containing any additional files and folders that you would like to be hosted by Bot!Battle!
			<ul>
				<li>  <p>Hosted at: /game/[Game Name]/resources/[Unzipped Resources]
				<li>  <p>This allows you to upload sprites, images, audio, and any anything else that your game javascript file might require to display and animate the game to the user. 
			</ul>
		</li>
      </ul>
      
   <h1> JSON GameStates </h1>
      <p> JSON Game states are used to communicate between your java Game class and your Game javascript file. 
	See <a href = "./jsonGameStates.html" > JSON Game States</a> to learn more about
	these game states, what components they must include, and see some examples.
	
	<h1> Initial Configuration </h1>
	<p> The initial configuration must be run in order to upload and use a new game on the system.
	<p> Upon startup, main.js looks for a file named savedConfiguration.txt in the application root directory.
		If this file doesn't exist then the initial configuration app is loaded, otherwise the system uses a
		pre-existing database and continues straight to the Test Arena.
		
	<p> To get the initial configuration to run again, just delete the savedConfiguration.txt file.
