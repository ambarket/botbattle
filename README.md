# Bot! Battle!
Bot!Battle! is an application designed to support and encourage students to gain an early enthusiasm for computer science and programming. Students will write small “bots”, or simple programs that are designed to play a game. Bot!Battle! will host tournaments in which the students’ bots will compete for the title of most awesome bot. In addition, students will be able to test their bots, both against themselves or against another bot, via a publically accessible portal where they can watch their bots play the game.  Also, Bot!Battle! is extensible in that it allows new games to be developed and then uploaded for use in new tournaments.
