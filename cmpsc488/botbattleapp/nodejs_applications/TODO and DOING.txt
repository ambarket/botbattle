Move file tests out of InitialConfigurationApp.js to a seperate FileTestApp.js and out of 
        inititalConfiguration.html to fileTest.html
        
Finish FileManager after setting up initConfig html and wiring to know what is needed (add to after test arena also)

Look into Multer more for initConfig and testArena to see if necessary
        
Move Test Arena socket.io connection handshake proposal.txt from investigate io branch to master branch 
      then start a new branch to work on Test Arena
      
In test arena branch make a new testArena.html and use basicInOutErr.html as a template and
     modify botBattleApp.js to work with test arena 
     
Add other html pages and set up wiring by modifying botBattleApp.js (maybe new branches for each of these
      until they work)  
      
******Keep Master as clean and functional as possible!!!
